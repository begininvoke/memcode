// Package runtimes models where an autonomous task's inference actually runs.
//
// Five things are kept deliberately separate, because collapsing them is how a
// credential someone happens to have becomes authority a daemon quietly spends:
//
//	AVAILABILITY   a runtime exists on this machine
//	AUTHORIZATION  the user has explicitly allowed tasks to use it
//	CAPABILITY     it can actually serve what this task needs
//	SELECTION      which authorized, capable runtime to use
//	FALLBACK       what may be tried when the RUNTIME itself fails
//
// Availability never implies authorization. A Claude Code or Codex login lives
// in another tool's files; the user signed into THAT tool, not into a scheduler
// that will spend their quota at 3am unattended. Discovering one may produce an
// offer, never an entitlement — the same line internal/provider/credsource.go
// draws for interactive sessions, held here for unattended ones.
